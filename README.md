Working repo for my doom / stoner concept album project.

This exists to:
- Centralize all doom project notes that were previously scattered across chats
- Track creative decisions (lore, lyrics, structure)
- Track technical decisions (tones, tunings, DAW templates)
- Keep a simple status overview of each song

## Concept Snapshot

A long-form doom record about a civilization that solved nearly everything… except getting beyond its dying star.

Themes:
- Late-stage global civilization, many cultures fused into one “world culture”
- Silence after planetary destruction
- Devotion, sacrifice, and “we did everything right, but too late”
- Cosmic isolation and failure to become truly spacefaring

Working album title: **The Last Choir of Ash**  
Project / band umbrella (tentative): **Choir of Ash**

## Global Production Specs

- **DAW**: Reaper on Pop!_OS  
- **Interface**: PreSonus AudioBox iTwo  
- **Tuning**: Drop A (guitar & bass)
- **Key center (so far)**: A minor, with excursions / modal colors (incl. A Lydian for *Ashes in Orbit*)
- **Core chord language**: Am – C – Dm and related modal moves
- **Tempo baseline**: ~**90 BPM** doom groove
- **Drums**:
  - DrumGizmo kits (Muljord as current stand-in; Crocell kit later if/when sorted)
- **Ambience & Orchestration**:
  - Church bells, wind, sonar pings
  - Strings + woodwinds reinforcing key progressions
  - Swells that breathe in and out of the main riffs

## Current Track List

1. **Echoes from the Dying Star**
2. **The Throne of Silence**
3. **Ashes in Orbit**
4. **We Lit the Fire for No One**

More tracks may be added as the album arc develops.
