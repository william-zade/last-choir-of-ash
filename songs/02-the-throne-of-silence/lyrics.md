# The Throne of Silence  
by The Last Choir of Ash

---

## Verse I

The last ships tore the clouds in two,  
Trails of fire across the dusk.  
We watched them fade to dust and blue,  
Their echoes falling back to us.  

The launch pads cooled, the sirens died,  
No voices left to count the cost.  
We stood in streets grown wide and wide,  
A crowd of waiting, willingly lost.  

---

## Chorus I

We take our seats on the Throne of Silence,  
Where no one speaks and no one pleads.  
No trumpets sound, no banners rising —  
Just empty hands and slowing hearts that bleed.  

We are the ones who chose to listen,  
When all the futures closed their doors.  
We crown ourselves with ash and stillness,  
And swear to never beg for more.  

---

## Verse II

The temples cracked, their idols gone,  
Their books unread, their candles cold.  
The names of gods that led us on  
Were weathered smooth from stone and gold.  

Yet in the halls where choirs once burned,  
A quiet shape walked in our place.  
No halo worn, no visage turned —  
Just shadow draped in patient grace.  

---

## Chorus II

We take our seats on the Throne of Silence,  
Our voices swallowed by the sky.  
No choirs remain to buy us mercy,  
No wings descend to ask us why.  

We are the choir without an altar,  
The final verse without a psalm.  
We trade our screams for knowing glances,  
And let the dying star grow calm.  

**Chant (beneath chorus):**  
> "No more prayers. No more lies."  
> "No more hymns to empty skies."  
> "Silence sits where kings have shone."  
> "We stay. We stay. We die at home."  

---

## Verse III

We built no ark, we dug no throne  
Of gilded steel above the rain.  
Our kingdom is the ground we own,  
Our heritage: the honest pain.  

We watch the oceans climb the land,  
We feel the seasons fall apart.  
But no one lifts a pleading hand —  
We hold each other, heart to heart.  

---

## Bridge

Let those who fled chase foreign suns,  
And gamble with the dark between.  
We are the weight that never runs,  
The pulse that leaves no lasting scene.  

For when the star at last awakens,  
To burn away our brittle skin,  
We will not stand as ones forsaken —  
We’ll meet the fire from within.  

No choirs rise in desperate thunder,  
No final bargain, no demand.  
Just quiet breaths and shoulders under  
The simple fact: *this is our land.*  

---

## Verse IV / Despair’s Aside

In corners where the shadows lean,  
Another watcher takes his place.  
He is not wrathful, not serene —  
Just tired eyes in tired space.  

He speaks in thoughts we do not share,  
A god with nothing left to win:  
> "I lost my only rival, Hope,  
> The day you chose to turn within."  

---

## Final Chorus

We take our seats on the Throne of Silence,  
With bleeding crowns and open eyes.  
No saving hand, no last reprisal —  
Just all we are beneath these skies.  

If Despair walks the streets beside us,  
He does not ask, he does not reign.  
He only stays until it’s over,  
And sinks with us into the flame.  

**Final Chant (fading):**  
> "No more fear. No more flight."  
> "Hold this ground. Face this light."  
> "Hope is gone. Despair stands near."  
> "We are the Throne. We disappear."
