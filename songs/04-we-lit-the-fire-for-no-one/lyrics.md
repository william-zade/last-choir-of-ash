# We Lit the Fire for No One  
by The Last Choir of Ash

---

## Verse I

The streets were wet with falling ash,  
The sky a low and rusted dome.  
We walked the lines where rivers crashed  
Through broken steel and buried stone.  

We found the square where once they sang,  
Where names were carved in glass and gold.  
Now only dust and silence hang —  
A hollow stage, a bitter cold.  

---

## Chorus I

We lit the fire for no one,  
No witness left to see it rise.  
No choirs above, no hosts below,  
Just failing lungs and open eyes.  

We built a pyre of all we were,  
Of flags and books and shattered crowns.  
We lit the fire for no one —  
And watched the last light burn it down.  

---

## Verse II

We gathered scripts of promised dawn,  
The laws that swore we’d reach the stars.  
We tore them gently, not with scorn,  
And fed them to the waiting sparks.  

Old uniforms and sacred cloth,  
The relics of ascending years,  
We laid them down like broken oaths,  
And gave them to the flame with tears.  

---

## Chorus II

We lit the fire for no one,  
No savior left to bless the flame.  
No future eyes to judge our worth,  
No distant heirs to speak our name.  

The smoke rose up to meet the clouds,  
A last black hymn against the sky.  
We lit the fire for no one —  
And felt our last illusions die.  

**Chant (beneath chorus):**  
> "No more thrones. No gilded lies."  
> "No more stars to colonize."  
> "Here we burn what we were shown."  
> "We are nothing. We are known."

## Verse III

Some lit small lamps on windowsills,  
For lovers lost and unborn sons.  
Some traced soft circles on the sills,  
For nameless dead and distant ones.  

We did not ask for signs or rain,  
We did not beg the fire to speak.  
We only warmed our hands in pain,  
And held each other, worn and weak.

## Bridge

The flames threw ghosts along the walls,  
Of ships that never left the ground.  
Of children dancing in the halls,  
Of cities whole, of unsung crowns.  

We watched them flicker, thin and frail,  
Then fold back into coal and ash.  
Each spark a timeline, each exhale  
A universe we couldn’t catch.  

---

## Verse IV / Despair’s Verse

Along the edge of firelight,  
A quiet figure took his place.  
No halo burned, no armor bright —  
Just tired steps and ancient face.  

He spoke in embers, not in words,  
A god with nothing left to win:  
> “I came because there’s no one else  
> To see you as you truly end.”  

> “She fought to pull you from this ground,  
> Your Hope who tore the sky in two.  
> She failed, and in that failing drowned —  
> But every spark here sings of you.”  

---

## Final Chorus

We lit the fire for no one,  
No distant stars, no watching eyes.  
We fed it all we could have been,  
We burned our flags and alibis.  

If Despair stayed beside the coals,  
He did not rule, he did not reign.  
He only watched as, one by one,  
We laid our stories in the flame.  

**Final Chant (fading):**  
> "Not for gods. Not for the sky."  
> "Only us, and how we die."  
> "Hope is gone, her embers flown."  
> "We lit this fire for us alone."
