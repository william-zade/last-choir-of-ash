# The Day We Measured the End  
by The Last Choir of Ash

## Verse I – Anomalies

We watched the numbers slip and slide,  
A quiet drift in stellar light.  
Small deviations in the tide,  
A shiver in the ancient night.  

The graphs grew teeth and bent their lines,  
The cycles slipped, the curves ran wild.  
What once was steady, clean, and fine  
Now shook like fever through a child.

## Chorus I

This was the day we measured the end —  
Wrote its shape in charts and code.  
Drew the cliff where all roads bend,  
Marked the fault beneath our homes.  

On every screen the verdict burned,  
A falling sun, a shrinking span.  
This was the day the future turned,  
The hourglass in human hands.

## Verse II – Telling the World

We took the models to the halls,  
To towers, temples, broadcast feeds.  
We spoke in ratios and falls,  
In orbits failing at the seams.  

Some laughed it off as passing storm,  
Some raged at numbers drawn in chalk.  
But in the silence after words,  
We heard the ticking in their talk.  

---

## Chorus II

This was the day we measured the end,  
Set the bounds of all our years.  
Not in omens, not in hymns —  
But in error bars and fears.  

Yet from the margins of the page,  
A softer voice began to rise:  
“This is the time to build and change,  
Not close your hearts, not shut your eyes.”

## Verse III – Hope Speaks

She walked the wires and city streets,  
In labcoat, banner, broken shoes.  
Her name was Hope in every tongue,  
A thousand faces, single truth.  

She said, “Your star is not your sin,  
Your doom is only if you sleep.  
You still can build, you still can mend,  
The years are few — but they are deep.”  

She lit up boards and factory floors,  
She turned the doubts to trembling hands.  
She whispered through assembly doors:  
> “You are not done. You still can stand.”

## Chorus III

This was the day we measured the end,  
But also drew our brightest schemes.  
Sketched out arks and darkened rings,  
Shipyard ghosts in waking dreams.  

We saw the distance, felt the weight,  
But chose to fight the falling sun.  
This was the day we named our fate,  
And swore we’d meet it on the run.

## Bridge – The Arguments

Some stood and shouted, “Let it come —  
We’ve earned the cinder and the coal.”  
Some in their towers whispered, “Run,”  
And eyed the black between the worlds.  

But Hope slammed trembling hands on glass,  
And painted stars on every wall.  
She said, “We’re late, but not yet past.  
We still can rise before we fall.”  

In corners dark where doubt made nests,  
Another watcher kept his place.  
He did not speak, he simply watched —  
A tired god with patient face.  

---

## Verse IV – The Pact

So we rewrote the maps of years,  
We carved new dates in stone and steel.  
Each calendar now marked in fear,  
But also in a sharpened will.  

We signed our names beneath the line:  
> “We know the end. We’ll go anyway.”  
To build the ships, the rings, the spires,  
To hurl ourselves against decay.  

---

## Final Chorus

This was the day we measured the end,  
And learned our sun would not forgive.  
But in the shadow of that sum,  
We chose a different way to live.  

We crowned our fear with restless fire,  
We bound our dread in iron and song.  
This was the day we saw the pyre —  
And still swore we would burn it long.  

**Final Refrain (soft, fading):**  
> “Mark the line. Count the years.”  
> “Build the ships. Face the fear.”  
> “Hope will climb where numbers send.”  
> “This was the day we named our end.”
