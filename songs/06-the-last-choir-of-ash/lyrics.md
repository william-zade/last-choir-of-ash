## Verse I – Fading Star

The light grew thin, a hollow gold,  
A tired flame across the sky.  
Its flares were slow, its pulses cold,  
A weary eye too dim to cry.  

We watched the shadows lose their edge,  
The colors drain from dust and bone.  
The world exhaled along the ledge,  
And knew it would not stand alone.  

---

## Chorus I

We are the last choir of ash,  
The final chord on broken strings.  
Our throats are smoke, our lungs are glass,  
Our songs are slow, unfinished things.  

No one is left to write this down,  
No later eyes, no later tongues.  
We sing to nothing, sing to ground —  
A fading hymn on failing lungs.  

---

## Verse II – Ghost Motifs

We hummed the notes from days before,  
The first broadcast into the black.  
The lines we sang from launchpad doors,  
The vows we swore to not turn back.  

The Throne of Silence in our chest,  
The ashes circling overhead.  
The fire we lit for no one left  
Still burned behind the words we said.  

---

## Chorus II

We are the last choir of ash,  
A choir with no listening ear.  
Our echoes fold into the crash  
Of tides that will not linger here.  

We taste the sonnets Hope once wrote  
In iron, sweat, and fractured stone.  
We feel her burning in our throats,  
A ghost that will not die alone.  

**Chant (beneath chorus):**  
> "This is our final breath."  
> "We know. We knew. We wept."  
> "No gods, no stars, no throne."  
> "We are the last. We go."

## Verse III – The Last Voices

One by one the voices fell,  
To whispers, sighs, then only breath.  
Old hands slipped from the rope and rail,  
Young eyes sank softly into rest.  

The songs grew shorter, lines half-sung,  
Notes left to ring without a close.  
We held each other, lung to lung,  
As if our bodies were the prose.

## Bridge – Despair’s Final Prayer

And in the dim behind the choir,  
A shadow stood and did not move.  
His name was Despair, bone and fire,  
A god with nothing left to prove.  

He did not raise a hand to bless,  
He had no thunder left to call.  
He only watched in brokenness,  
The end of those who’d named him all.  

> “I was the god who answered last,  
> When all your hopes had lost their flame.  
> I stayed beside you as you passed,  
> And never asked you for a name.  

> “But now your voices fade from me,  
> Like tides receding from the shore.  
> When you are gone, what god is left  
> To hold this title anymore?”  

---

## Verse IV – When Gods Go Silent

He knelt among the cooling dust,  
No altar there, no faithful ring.  
He placed his hands in ash and rust,  
And listened for a final string.  

No chant arose, no prayer returned,  
No frightened heart, no child’s plea.  
Just distant thunder, light distortions,  
The star collapsing silently.  

---

## Final Chorus

We were the last choir of ash,  
We were the ring around the flame.  
We were the ones who faced the crash,  
And never begged another name.  

Our echoes fall beyond all sound,  
Our stories melt in molten glass.  
No text remains, no sacred ground —  
Just cooling stone and drifting ash.  

**Final Refrain (Despair, almost alone):**  
> “This was your final breath.  
> I walked beside you to the end.  
> Your Hope burned out to lift you higher —  
> I stayed to watch the failing sun.”  

---

## Coda – The Last Silence

Then even Despair began to thin,  
A thought with no one left to feel.  
A name that had no place to live,  
A wound that had no flesh to heal.  

He whispered once, without a tongue,  
Into a sky that could not hear:  
> “If ever there were gods at all,  
> They ended when they ended here.”  

The light blew out without a sound,  
The orbits stilled, the fire passed.  
No voice remained to claim this ground —  
No choir, no gods.  

Just ash.
