# Echoes from the Dying Star  
by The Last Choir of Ash

---

## Verse I

We built our towers on the ash of moons,  
Drew power from the blood of suns.  
But now the sky has cracked and turned  
To silent red — the end begun.  

Our temples fall, their prayers expire,  
The gods of hope all turned to dust.  
Yet in the void, a voice conspired —  
A whisper deep, a god unjust.  

---

## Chorus I

This is our final breath,  
A song through static, bound for death.  
A whisper cast to dark unknowns —  
The dying star, the broken throne.  

**Chant (beneath chorus):**  
> "No light. No gods. No more."  
> "We fade. We fall. We know."  
> "Despair is all. Despair is all."

## Verse II

No savior came with wings of light,  
No heralds pierced the blackened veil.  
But Despair rose in robes of night,  
And laid his hand upon our trail.  

He spoke not lies, nor offered grace,  
But mercy cruel in form and face.  
“Drink deep,” he said, “my silent gift —  
The end of pain, the final drift.”  

---

## Chorus II

This is our funeral hymn,  
A requiem through circuits dim.  
Despair has heard our final cries —  
And kissed our soul as starlight dies.  

**Chant (beneath chorus):**  
> "End of flame. End of form."  
> "Black is truth. Cold is home."  
> "Despair is all. Despair is all."

## Bridge

He is the god that answers last,  
When hope has fled, when time has passed.  
He sits upon no golden throne —  
But rules the black, the cold, the alone.  

No hymns are sung in Despair’s name,  
No altars burn, no holy flame.  
Yet still he walks among the lost,  
And pays, in silence, all their cost.  

He does not rise above the ash,  
But sinks with us in twilight’s crash.  
He weeps no tears, he makes no sound —  
But dies with us beneath the ground.

## Verse III / Spoken Outro (Despair’s Voice)

"You called to gods that would not hear —"  
"But I was always standing near."  
"No heaven waits beyond your cries —"  
"Only I, beneath your skies."  

"My mercy is the end you seek,  
The silence vast, the numb, the weak.  
And when your light is swallowed whole —  
I too shall fade, and lose my soul."  

---

## Final Chorus

This is our final breath,  
A song through static, bound for death.  
Despair now cradles all we were —  
The dying star, the end assured.  

**Final Chant (fading into silence):**  
> "We fall. We fall. We fall."  
> "Despair is all. Despair is all."
