# Ashes in Orbit  
by The Last Choir of Ash

---

## Verse I

The sky has grown a shattered ring,  
A halo made of stone and bone.  
Our oceans climbed, our cities sank,  
Yet still that crown will not let go.  

The failed machines, the broken shells,  
The towers torn from root and wire —  
Now drift above in silent swells,  
A frozen choir around the fire.  

---

## Chorus I

Ashes in orbit, circling slow,  
Fragments of all we meant to know.  
Ruins of launch pads, bones of light,  
Haunting the edge of endless night.  

We reach our hands to where they turn,  
But nothing falls, and nothing burns.  
Just rings of dust we’ll never touch —  
The proof we almost were enough.  

---

## Verse II

The ships that left carved scars of blue,  
Then slipped beyond our failing sight.  
Their afterglow became a bruise  
Across the veins of thinning night.  

Above, the wrecks of dreams remain,  
A graveyard wrapped around our sky.  
We name each fragment, speak each name,  
Then let their orbit pass us by.  

---

## Chorus II

Ashes in orbit, dim and far,  
Worn-out teeth around a dying star.  
The ones who rose and those who fell  
Now share the same metallic shell.  

We send our signals to the ring,  
To ghosted hulls that cannot sing.  
The echoes answer, thin and weak —  
A static prayer we cannot speak.  

**Chant (beneath chorus):**  
> "We almost left. We almost soared."  
> "We forged the key, but not the door."  
> "Ashes in orbit, all we are."  
> "Broken halo, dying star."

## Verse III

Some nights the band glows faint and pale,  
A smear of embers, cold and drawn.  
We lie on rooftops, thin and frail,  
And watch our failures drift ‘til dawn.  

We see the shadows cross the moon,  
Old engines turned to quiet stones.  
The last equations, left half-hewn,  
Now circle us as nameless bones.  

---

## Bridge

If Hope once climbed that upward road,  
She left her fingerprints in fire —  
On steel that cracked beneath the load,  
On wings that couldn’t lift us higher.  

She burned herself against the sky,  
A final, wild, collapsing flare.  
The ring she left above our eyes  
Is all we have to say she cared.  

---

## Verse IV / Despair’s Interlude

“I watched you reach,” says Despair’s low tone,  
“Watched every launch, each failing stone.  
I saw your brightest nearly break  
The grip of gravity and fate.  

She tore herself apart to rise,  
Your fallen Hope, your brightest star.  
Her ashes drift before your eyes —  
That glowing ring is all she was.”

## Final Chorus

Ashes in orbit, soft and slow,  
A wreath for those who tried to go.  
A crown of ghosts above the sea,  
For all the lives that could not be.  

We stand beneath their circling trail,  
With empty hands and open scars.  
We never left, we never will —  
But part of us still haunts the stars.  

**Final Chant (fading):**  
> "We almost lived beyond this sky."  
> "We almost learned to never die."  
> "Hope is the ring that burns above."  
> "Ashes in orbit. We were love."
