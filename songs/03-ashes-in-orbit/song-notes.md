# Ashes in Orbit – Song Notes

## High-Level Concept

- Scene: The world is gone; its remains circle the dying star as a ring of ash.
- Emotional core: Weightless grief, bitter acceptance, “we almost made it.”
- Role in album: Mid-album track showing the cost of failure with a strange beauty.

## Musical Direction

- **Key / Mode**: A minor with bends into **A Lydian** for “alien but hopeful” color.
- **Tempo**: ~90 BPM (doom / stoner lurch)
- **Tuning**: Drop A
- **Rhythmic feel**: Slow, swinging groove; sections that open up into more floaty, spacey feels.

### Riff / Section Ideas

- **Intro**: Clean / lightly driven guitar with long reverb; ambient swells (wind, distant bells).
- **Main riff**: Big, sustaining Am / C / Dm with occasional Lydian #4 for lift.
- **Bridge**: Modal lead + strings/woodwinds doubling or answering the melody.
- **Outro**: Gradual decay into noise and orbital “whoosh” pans.

## Arrangement Skeleton (v1)

1. Ambient intro (0:00–0:45)
2. Main riff + drums (0:45–2:00)
3. Verse 1 (2:00–3:00)
4. Chorus / refrain (3:00–4:00)
5. Instrumental bridge / lead (4:00–5:30)
6. Final verse / refrain, more desperate (5:30–6:30)
7. Long fade / ambience (6:30–end)

## Production Notes

- **Guitars**: Thick doom tone; consider “Orange-ish” + tighter modern sim blend.
- **Bass**: Slight grit, audible notes, supports kick without being a clone of guitar.
- **Drums**: Doom-appropriate kit; clear kick definition. Consider 3–4 dB transient duck on bass when kick hits.
- **FX**:
  - Occasional sonar pings in open sections
  - Orbital whooshes panning around for “debris” feel

## To-Do

- [ ] Lock balance between A minor and A Lydian sections
- [ ] Write main riff + chorus progression in Reaper
- [ ] Draft basic drum pattern using Muljord kit
- [ ] First-pass vocal melody sketch
- [ ] Rough lyric dump
