## Cross-Track Motifs

- Recurring melodic fragments between songs (e.g., *Echoes* motif returns in *We Lit the Fire for No One* as a funeral theme).
- Cross-cultural hints via:
  - Modal lines inspired by non-Western scales
  - Percussion / textures suggesting a merged world culture (without caricature)
- Album should feel like a single civilization’s last liturgy.
